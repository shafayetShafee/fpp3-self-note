## Setup

```{r}
#| message: false
library(mgcv)            
library(tidyverse)       
library(marginaleffects) 
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork) 
```


```{r}
theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 12, base_family = 'serif') +
            theme(axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(colour = "black",
                                                    linewidth = 1),
                  axis.line.y.left = element_line(colour = "black",
                                                  linewidth = 1),
                  panel.spacing = unit(0, 'lines'),
                  legend.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, -15)))
```

```{r}
data(CO2, package = "datasets")
```

```{r}
glimpse(CO2)
```

```{r}
plot(CO2)
```


```{r}
CO2 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(plant = factor(plant, ordered = FALSE)) -> plant
```


```{r}
model_1 <- gam(
  uptake ~ treatment * type + 
    s(plant, bs = 're') +
    s(conc, by = treatment, k = 7),
  data = plant,
  method = "REML",
  family = Gamma(link = "log")
)

summary(model_1)
  
```

## Visulizing GAM Outputs

**Partial effect plots on the link scale**: plots that show the individual component effect of the smooth function on the link scale, conditional on all other terms in the model being zero.

```{r}
plot(model_1, select = 2, shade = TRUE)
```

This plot shows that, for the nonchilled treatment, the effect of conc on the linear predictor is mostly negative (below zero) for small values of `conc`, but it quickly becomes positive (above zero) for intermediate values of `conc.` It then begins to plateau at larger values of `conc.` We can also look at the effect for the other level of treatment.

```{r}
plot(model_1, select = 3, shade = TRUE)
```

This plot looks broadly similar, but it is not identical to the nonchilled treatment effect.


```{r}
plot_predictions(model_1, condition = "conc", type = "link") +
  labs(
    y = "Linear predictor (link scale)",
    title = "Average smooth effect of concentration",
    subtitle = "Aggregated across treatments and types"
  )
```
